# Posix-Tools-And-Utilities

POSIX, which stands for Portable Operating System Interface, is a set of standards specified by the IEEE. The primary purpose of POSIX tools and utilities is to ensure compatibility and portability across different operating systems.


## About This Codebase

This codebase aims to enhance the performance of the POSIX shell by leveraging the processing capabilities of POSIX `awk` and `sed` backends. By offloading data manipulation tasks to these powerful utilities, we achieve significant speed improvements and efficiency in script execution.


### Key Features

- **Compatibility**: Adheres to POSIX draft 1003.2 (draft 11.3) standards, ensuring broad compatibility across various UNIX-like operating systems.
- **Performance**: Utilizes `awk` and `sed` for backend processing, which are optimized for handling large datasets and complex text processing tasks.
- **Portability**: Scripts are designed to be portable and can be easily integrated into different environments without modification.


### Usage

To use these scripts, ensure that your environment supports POSIX-compliant `awk` and `sed`. Detailed usage instructions and examples can be found in the `docs` directory.
